Nucleotide sequences of putative atg162 homologs in multiple isolates.

Positions to extract were based on the results of a BLASTn search against each isolate.
These sequences are the best matching genomic regions Â± 200 bases for each candidate.

Sequence ids in the fasta are named as:

	<isolate>-<scaffold>:<start>..<end>

_Venturia inaequalis_ isolates represented in this fasta are:

- B04
- I17V
- I19A
- I31A
- I37A
- I5V
- I61A
