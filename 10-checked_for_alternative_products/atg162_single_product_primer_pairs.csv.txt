Primer pair candidates for AvrRvi5 candidate atg162 for all isolates.

Primers were blasted in step 22.
Here I filtered those BLAST hits and did pairwise testing to see if primer pairs could product products.

Matches were considered significant if the:

- melting temperature of the match was greater than 45.0^oC
- The 3' end of the actual primer was included in the BLAST hit

Primer pairs were considered to be relevant if:
- The two primers are on different strands
- The length of the potential product is less than 8000
- The primers are on the same scaffold
