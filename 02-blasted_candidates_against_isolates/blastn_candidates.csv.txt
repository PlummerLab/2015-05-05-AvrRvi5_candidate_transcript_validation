BLASTN search of _Venturia inaequalis AvrRvi5_ candidates against a BLAST database constructed from the genome of isolates.

Depends on the fasta file containing candidates '01-extracted_candidates/candidate_gene_sequences.fasta'.

It was constructed with the NCBI BLAST+ 2.2.29 build Jun  7 2014 15:55:48 program 'blastn' with the following command:

```bash
blastn -out 02-blasted_candidates_against_isolates/blastn_candidates.csv -outfmt "6 qseqid sseqid qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore length pident sstrand" -query 01-extracted_candidates/candidate_gene_sequences.fasta -db data/combined -evalue 0.1 -num_threads 3
```

The table is tab ("\t") separated with the following columns (in order):

- qseqid
- sseqid
- qstart
- qend
- sstart
- send
- evalue
- bitscore
- length
- pident
- sstrand

Column names with the prefix 'q' refer to query sequence information and those with  's' refer to the matched sequence.

These messages came from running the code:

```
