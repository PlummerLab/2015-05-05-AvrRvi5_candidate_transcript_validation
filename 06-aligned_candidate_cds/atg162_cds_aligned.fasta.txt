Alignment of putative _Venturia inaequalis_ MNH120 atg162 homolog CDS's.

Depends on 03-extracted_candidate_genes/atg162_nucleotide_cds.fasta.

Alignments were constructed using T-Coffee Version_11.00.8cbe486 with the following command run from the project base directory:

```
t_coffee -output fasta_aln,score_html,score_ascii -infile S03-extracted_candidate_genes/atg162_nucleotide_cds.fasta -outfile 06-aligned_candidate_cds/atg162_cds_aligned.fasta -type dna -mode mcoffee
```

Note that the preliminary newick tree generated (atg162_nucleotide_cds.dnd) were automatically constructed by T-Coffee in the project base directory and were later moved into this folder.

Both a machine readable file 06-aligned_candidate_cds/atg162_cds_aligned.fasta and the easy-on-the-eye file 06-aligned_candidate_cds/atg162_cds_aligned.fasta.score_html represent the same information.

Sequence ids are named as:

	<isolate>-<scaffold>-<gene id>
